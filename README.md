This project contains examples I've used in a presentation (Scala Taipei meetup) about typeclass in Scala.

The presentation slides is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16WwEFbawzecu10H4I5oSFutHS8HTEkvAabOuAcOX8bQ/edit).

For explanations on explicit resolution in Scala 2.10.x, please read [this stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10763511/implicit-resolution-in-scala-2-10-x-whats-going-on) for detail.

To get this project up and running, use either sbt-0.12.0-Beta2 or [this excellent sbt wrapper](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras).  After sbt is fired up, it will pull the required scala-2.10.0-SNAPSHOT from the Sonatype snapshot repo and you will be good to go.
